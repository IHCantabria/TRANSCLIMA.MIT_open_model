# Modified TCrisk


## Description
This repository contains a **modified version** of the [TCrisk](https://github.com/linjonathan/tropical_cyclone_risk) model.  
While the **core algorithm** remains the same, this version includes:
- **Parallel execution support** for faster simulations.
- **Preprocessing scripts** for streamlined input preparation.
- **Postprocessing utilities** for results analysis and visualization.

It is designed to work efficiently with **ERA5 reanalysis datasets** and GCMs.

## Installation

```bash
# Create environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate tc_risk

# Install ERA5 download API
pip install cdsapi

# Configure CDS API credentials
# (Instructions: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to)
# Save your credentials as ~/.cdsapirc
```

## Quick Start Example in Local for ERA5 
```bash
conda activate tc_risk
python scripts/download_era5.py
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
python run.py NA
python postprocessing/return_period.py
```
After running, youâ€™ll find output files in the `data/test/` directory, including tracks and return period plots.
